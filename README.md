# Readme Generator
  License: ISC
  ## Description
  I built this project to create better readme files.

  The creation of readme files can be a hassle.  Furthermore, many readme files lack consistency with the proper convention.  This readme generator solves these problems!

  This project helped me to learn to better use Nodejs, especially to create files.

  This project stands out because I made it.
